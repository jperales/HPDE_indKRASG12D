Title	KRAS-induced transcription analysis in immortalized pancreatic cells
Organism	Homo sapiens
Experiment type	Expression profiling by array
Summary	We utilized non-transformed, human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells, previously engineered with the E6 and E7 proteins of the HPV16 virus to emulate loss of p53 and inactivation of the Rb pathway, respectively. Given the frequent activation of KRAS (>90% PDAC tumors) and its early role in pancreatic neoplasia, we sought to engineer HPDE cells containing KRASG12D to provide the appropriate context in which to screen for novel drivers that might represent KRAS effectors.
 	
Overall design	The KRAS-induced transcription analysis was conducted using RNAs extracted from HPDE cells transduced with either control, wild-type KRAS or KRASG12D(pInducer) with or without DOX (100ng/ml) for 72 h, followed by hybridization of labeled cDNA onto Agilent arrays (Agilent G3 Human GE 8x60K) by the Baylor College of Medicine Genome Profiling Core Facility.
